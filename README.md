# Children of the Corn 2024 Robot Code

Code written by [FIRST Robotics Competition Team 167, Children of the Corn](https://github.com/icrobotics-team167) for the 2024 FRC season.

AdvantageKit's "log literally everything" approach is used here, to allow for extremely robust debugging and simulations. In addition, it also has capabilities for high frequency odometry and vision-based pose estimation, giving it high confidence in knowing where the robot is at on the field at all times.

## License

This project uses the GNU-GPL v3 open-source license. Due to the nature of the GNU-GPL v3 license, we cannot *under any circumstances*, provide warranty for the function of this code. For more information, read the `LICENSE` file or read a summary of the license [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

## General Usage

- Always commit any changes before deploying code to the robot.
  - When committing changes, always include the name of the person committing in the commit description. The commit description should also contain details of what actually changed in the commit.
- [The Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) is enforced via the [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) plugin for gradle. It is recommended to use the [Spotless Gradle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richardwillis.vscode-spotless-gradle) extension for VSCode as your Java formatter so that the code style guidelines are always followed.
- Programmers should use [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope) for telemetry data, and drivers should use [Elastic](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard) for match data.

## Known issues

- VSCode's highlighter is known to kinda... forget where classes are, and this happens most often with classes autogenerated by AdvantageKit. (We once had an issue where the highlighter said that `String` doesn't exist) To fix this, compile the code, reload VScode a bunch, and if those both fail, open the command palette and run `Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace`.
